# Stashboard Notifier

Command line executable for sending messages to a Stashboard instance
([http://www.stashboard.org]((http://www.stashboard.org)).

Uses the stashboard gem to send messages.

## WARNING

**This is very much alpha software, and doesn't have any proper tests or anything
much of substance to it. I may clean up any crufty bits, and add test coverage
if I get round to it.**

## Intended uses

This is intended for integration with a tool like Nagios, which can be
configured to call arbitrary commands should certain events happen in your
server infrastructure. These commands can be anything, but they need some sort
of command line tool to send the messages.

## Usage

   List services

   $ stashboard_notifier services

   List statuses

   $ stashboard_notifier statuses

   Create a new event for a service

   $ stashboard_notifier events --service=website --status=down "Website is down"

## Configuration

Every command needs at minimum 3 config options: the url to the stashboard
instance, and an oauth_token and oauth_secret for that stashboard. These can be
passed in as flags with each command invocation, but for convenience they can
be specified in a config file, which is written into
$HOME/.stashboard_notifier.

A skeleton config file can be generated by running:

    $ stashboard_notifier initconfig

Then this file should be edited to add your relevant details.

Subsequently, you won't need to provide any of these details.
